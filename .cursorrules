# LightSpeedPay Project Rules

## Implementation Patterns

### Database Schema
- All tables should have created_at and updated_at timestamps
- Use UUID as primary keys across all tables
- Follow proper naming conventions (snake_case for tables and columns)
- Add appropriate indexes for columns used in WHERE clauses
- Encrypt sensitive data (API keys, credentials) before storage

### Code Structure
- Follow a clean architecture approach
- Group code by feature rather than by type
- Use repository pattern for database access
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Create abstractions for external services

### API Design
- All endpoints should validate inputs using Zod schemas
- Return consistent error formats across all APIs
- Include appropriate status codes and messages
- Implement rate limiting for public-facing endpoints
- Document all APIs with clear request/response examples

### Security Practices
- Never log sensitive information
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Generate strong, random API keys and salts
- Implement proper CORS policies

### Development Workflow
- Follow conventional commits format
- Write tests for critical components
- Document changes in memory bank
- Keep third-party dependencies to a minimum
- Perform regular security audits

## Project-Specific Intelligence
- Primary focus is on reliability and security
- Critical payment data should never be lost
- Real-time monitoring is essential
- System should handle graceful degradation
- Favor consistency over performance when necessary

### Testing Patterns (Added 2025-06-14)
- Jest default test environment is `jsdom` to enable React component and hook rendering in unit tests.
- Use `@testing-library/react` / `@testing-library/react-hooks` for React unit testing; avoid JSX in *.test.tsx by preferring `React.createElement` when helpers complain under ts-jest.
- Provide module mocks for third-party ESM packages (e.g., `@supabase/supabase-js`) in `jest.setup.ts` to sidestep CommonJS/ESM interop issues.
- Collect coverage only from files explicitly tested to keep the signal clean; project and patch thresholds enforced at â‰¥ 80 % via Codecov status checks.
