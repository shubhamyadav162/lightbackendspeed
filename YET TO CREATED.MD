What is yet to be created/pending:
Essentially, almost all functional components of the LightSpeedPay project are still in the development phase.
Database Setup:
Setting up the Supabase project.
Implementing the Prisma schema based on the defined tables (Merchants, Payment Gateways, Merchant PG Credentials, Transactions, Settlements, Alerts).
Populating initial data.
Core Authentication:
Implementing merchant registration.
Developing API key/salt generation logic.
Building the JWT authentication middleware.
Setting up HMAC signature validation for API requests.
Basic Payment Flow:
Creating the unified payment API endpoint (/api/pay).
Implementing transaction record creation.
Developing the logic for selecting the best payment gateway.
Building the webhook handler structure (/api/webhook/[pg_code]).
Creating the public checkout page (/checkout/[merchant_id]/[txn_id]) with QR code generation and UPI intent buttons.
Implementing the Transaction Status API (/api/transaction/[txn_id]).
Gateway Integration:
Implementing the payment gateway abstraction layer.
Developing multi-gateway routing logic.
Creating the failover mechanism.
Setting up the sandbox LightSpeed gateway with its mock endpoints.
Dashboard Development:
Building the complete Merchant Dashboard with all specified pages (Overview, Transactions, Analytics, Settings, Integration).
Creating the Admin Dashboard with all specified pages (Overview, Gateways, Merchants, Transactions, Alerts, Analytics).
Implementing real-time updates using Supabase for both dashboards.
Developing analytics and reporting features.
If applicable, building the Super Admin Dashboard.
Background Jobs:
Setting up BullMQ on Railway.
Implementing all specified jobs: Transaction Monitor Job, Gateway Health Check Job, Settlement Processing Job, and Alert Generation Job.
Configuring Redis for queue management.
Advanced Features:
Implementing settlement processing logic.
Adding wallet management functionality.
Creating a comprehensive alert system with notifications.
Building real-time monitoring components beyond just Supabase subscriptions.
Client SDKs and Documentation:
Developing the Unity SDK (C#).
Building the Web SDK (JavaScript/TypeScript).
Generating comprehensive API documentation.
Creating integration guides for merchants.
Testing:
Setting up and writing comprehensive unit tests.
Developing integration tests for end-to-end flows.
Performing thorough sandbox testing for all scenarios.
Security, Monitoring, and Performance:
Implementing AES-256 encryption for credentials and sensitive data.
Setting up rate limiting, JWT token expiration, and request signature validation.
Implementing role-based access control and API key rotation.
Setting up health monitoring (API, DB, Jobs).
Configuring performance monitoring and error tracking.
Performing performance optimization.
Regarding Railway Deployment and GitHub Deployment:
The payment_gateway_pda.md specifies the configuration for Vercel and Railway, and outlines the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub. However, it does not state that these are already implemented.
Vercel Deployment: The configuration for Next.js on Vercel is described, but the actual deployment setup and connection to a GitHub repository are still pending.
Railway Deployment: Similarly, the configuration for BullMQ workers on Railway is provided, but the actual Railway project setup, deployment, and connection to a GitHub repository are yet to be done.
GitHub and CI/CD: The document mentions using GitHub for version control and setting up an automated CI/CD pipeline for deployments to Vercel (frontend/API), Railway (background jobs), and Supabase (database migrations/Edge Functions). This CI/CD pipeline itself needs to be implemented and configured to connect GitHub pushes to Vercel and Railway deployments, and to manage Supabase.
Supabase Connection: The document mentions connecting BullMQ jobs on Railway to Supabase for database operations and using Supabase Realtime for live updates. This connection needs to be established and verified during the implementation phase.
When can we go live with this project?
Based on the extensive list of pending tasks, the project is currently not ready to go live.
To go live, all the functional components, including authentication, payment processing, gateway integration, dashboards, and background jobs, must be fully developed, thoroughly tested (unit, integration, and sandbox), and secured. Additionally, the entire deployment infrastructure (Vercel, Railway, Supabase) needs to be set up, connected, and the CI/CD pipeline must be functional and robust. Performance optimization and comprehensive monitoring also need to be in place.
In essence, we are currently in the initial blueprinting and foundational setup phase. The "Day 1", "Day 2", and "Day 3" tasks outlined in the PDA represent significant development efforts that need to be completed before considering a "go live" date.
