## Technical Decisions

1. **Frontend Design Approach**
   - Decision: Use a component-based architecture with Shadcn/UI and Tailwind CSS
   - Rationale: Ensures consistency, improves developer productivity, and allows for easy theme customization
   - Alternative Considered: Material UI or Chakra UI, but Shadcn/UI provided better customization options

2. **Data Visualization Strategy**
   - Decision: Implement Recharts for analytics dashboards
   - Rationale: Recharts provides responsive, customizable charts that work well with React
   - Alternative Considered: Chart.js, but Recharts offers better React integration

3. **Error Handling Approach**
   - Decision: Implement specific error classes for different error types
   - Rationale: Allows for more precise error handling and better user feedback
   - Alternative Considered: Generic error handling with status codes, but specific classes provide better type safety

4. **Caching Strategy**
   - Decision: In-memory cache with automatic invalidation on mutations
   - Rationale: Reduces API calls for frequently accessed data without complex setup
   - Alternative Considered: Service worker caching, but in-memory approach offers more control

5. **Logging Implementation**
   - Decision: Structured logging with context enrichment and severity levels
   - Rationale: Provides rich information for debugging while controlling verbosity
   - Alternative Considered: Simple console logging, but structured approach better supports production monitoring

6. **Scaling Approach**
   - Decision: Phased scaling with initial optimizations before horizontal scaling
   - Rationale: Maximizes current infrastructure efficiency before adding costs
   - Alternative Considered: Immediate horizontal scaling, but optimization-first approach is more cost-effective

7. **Launch Strategy**
   - Decision: Soft launch with limited partners before full public launch
   - Rationale: Allows for real-world testing with controlled risk
   - Alternative Considered: Direct public launch, but soft launch provides safer validation

8. **Post-Launch Optimization**
   - Decision: Implement data-driven, phased optimization approach
   - Rationale: Allows for targeted improvements based on actual usage patterns
   - Alternative Considered: Proactive optimization, but real-world data provides better ROI

9. **Security Audit Methodology**
   - Decision: Comprehensive multi-layered security audit before launch
   - Rationale: Ensures thorough coverage of all security aspects in payment processing
   - Alternative Considered: Continuous security testing, which will be implemented in addition to pre-launch audit
