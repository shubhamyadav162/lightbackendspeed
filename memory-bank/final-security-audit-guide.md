  - Black box testing of public-facing components
  - Exploitation attempt of discovered vulnerabilities
  - Simulated attack scenarios

- **Internal Vulnerability Assessment**
  - White box testing with code review
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning
  - Docker image security scanning

## Audit Methodology

### 1. Automated Security Scanning

- **Tools to Use**:
  - OWASP ZAP for web application scanning
  - SonarQube for code quality and security issues
  - npm audit / snyk for dependency vulnerabilities
  - Trivy for container scanning
  - CloudFormation/Terraform linters for IaC

- **Process**:
  - Run automated scans on staging environment
  - Analyze and categorize findings by severity
  - Generate detailed reports for remediation

### 2. Manual Code Review

- **Focus Areas**:
  - Authentication implementations
  - Payment processing logic
  - Sensitive data handling
  - Error handling and logging
  - Security-critical functions

- **Process**:
  - Security-focused pair programming sessions
  - Use of security code review checklists
  - Documentation of findings

### 3. Penetration Testing

- **Attack Vectors to Test**:
  - Authentication bypass attempts
  - Authorization bypass attempts
  - SQL/NoSQL injection
  - XSS and CSRF attacks
  - Rate limiting bypass
  - Business logic exploitation

- **Process**:
  - Engage external security consultants
  - Define scope and rules of engagement
  - Execute tests in staging environment
  - Document findings with proof of concept

## Remediation Process

### 1. Vulnerability Triage

- Categorize findings by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Assess potential impact and exploitation difficulty
- Calculate risk scores for prioritization

### 2. Remediation Planning

- Create tickets for all identified issues
- Assign priorities based on risk assessment
- Allocate resources for remediation

### 3. Verification Process

- Implement fixes for identified vulnerabilities
- Conduct verification testing for each fix
- Re-run automated scans to confirm resolution

## Documentation Requirements

### 1. Audit Reports

- Executive summary of findings
- Detailed technical report with all vulnerabilities
- Risk assessment and recommendations
- Compliance status assessment

### 2. Remediation Documentation

- Complete list of identified issues
- Remediation actions taken
- Verification results
- Outstanding items and mitigation plans

## Post-Audit Activities

### 1. Security Training

- Security awareness session based on audit findings
- Secure coding practices workshop
- Incident response training

### 2. Policy Updates

- Update security policies based on findings
- Enhance security requirements documentation
- Refine security testing procedures
