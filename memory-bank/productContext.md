# LightSpeedPay - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
LightSpeedPay addresses the challenges merchants face when integrating with multiple payment gateways. Instead of managing separate integrations, error handling, and monitoring for each gateway, merchants can use a single unified API that handles:
- Gateway selection and routing
- Error handling and retries
- Monitoring and alerting
- Failover mechanisms
- Consistent checkout experience

## Problems It Solves
1. **Integration Complexity**: Reduces the technical burden of integrating with multiple payment providers
2. **Reliability Concerns**: Ensures transactions don't fail silently through comprehensive monitoring and alerting
3. **Gateway Dependencies**: Provides automatic failover when a gateway experiences downtime
4. **Testing Challenges**: Offers a sandbox environment for simulating various payment scenarios
5. **Consistency Issues**: Delivers a uniform checkout experience regardless of the underlying gateway

## How It Should Work
1. **Merchant Onboarding**: Simple registration process with automatic API key/salt generation
2. **API-First Approach**: Clean, well-documented APIs for all operations
3. **Smart Routing**: Automatic selection of best-performing gateway based on health and priority
4. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of gateway health with automatic failover
5. **Comprehensive Dashboards**: Detailed analytics and management interfaces for merchants and admins
