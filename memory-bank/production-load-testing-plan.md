   - Identify API endpoint response time degradations
   - Discover memory or CPU limitations

3. **Verify Failover Mechanisms**
   - Test automatic gateway failover under high load
   - Validate recovery procedures after system stress
   - Confirm alert mechanisms trigger appropriately

4. **Measure Scalability**
   - Evaluate system behavior with incremental load increases
   - Assess the effectiveness of auto-scaling configurations
   - Determine scaling thresholds and trigger points

5. **Simulate Real-World Scenarios**
