# LightSpeedPay - Scaling Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the strategy for scaling the LightSpeedPay platform to handle increased transaction volumes, user growth, and geographic expansion. The plan addresses infrastructure, database, application, and operational scaling considerations to ensure the platform maintains its 99.9% uptime guarantee as it grows.

## Current State

### Transaction Volume
- Average daily transactions: ~50,000
- Peak transactions per minute: ~500
- Average response time: 250ms
- Current database size: 25GB

### Infrastructure
- Frontend: Vercel (Next.js application)
- API: Vercel Serverless Functions
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL (Single instance)
- Background Jobs: BullMQ on Railway (2 worker instances)
- Caching: In-memory with Redis

## Growth Projections

### 6-Month Projection
- Daily transactions: 150,000 (+200%)
- Peak transactions per minute: 1,500 (+200%)
- Database size: 75GB (+200%)

- Merchant accounts: 2,000 (+500%)

## Scaling Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Optimizations (1-2 Months)

#### Database Optimization
1. **Indexing Strategy**
   - Add composite indexes for commonly queried fields
   - Implement partial indexes for filtered queries
   - Review and optimize existing indexes

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Identify and optimize slow queries
   - Implement query caching for read-heavy operations
   - Use materialized views for complex reporting queries

3. **Connection Pooling**
   - Implement proper connection pooling
   - Set appropriate connection limits
   - Monitor connection usage

#### Application Optimization
1. **Caching Enhancement**
   - Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add cache invalidation policies
   - Configure appropriate TTL for different data types

2. **API Optimization**
   - Implement response compression
   - Add pagination for list endpoints
   - Optimize payload size

3. **Background Processing**
   - Optimize job scheduling
   - Implement job batching for similar operations
   - Add priority queues for critical operations

### Phase 2: Horizontal Scaling (3-6 Months)

#### Database Scaling

     - Gateway Service
     - Reporting Service
   - Implement service discovery and API gateway

2. **Worker Scaling**
   - Increase worker instances for background jobs

   - Separate workers by job type for better resource allocation

3. **Frontend Optimization**
   - Implement edge caching for static assets
   - Use CDN for global distribution
   - Optimize client-side rendering and bundle size

### Phase 3: Geographic Expansion (7-12 Months)

#### Multi-Region Deployment
1. **Database Strategy**
   - Evaluate multi-region database options:
     - Multi-region read replicas
     - Active-passive configuration
     - Active-active with conflict resolution
   - Implement data residency controls for compliance

2. **Application Deployment**
   - Deploy application stack to multiple regions
   - Implement global load balancing
   - Set up region-specific configurations

3. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Implement region-aware monitoring
   - Set up cross-region alerting
   - Develop regional health dashboards

## Technical Implementation

### Database Scaling

#### Indexing Strategy
```sql
-- Example indexing improvements
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_merchant_created_at ON transactions(merchant_id, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_status_created_at ON transactions(status, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_webhook_events_status_created_at ON webhook_events(status, created_at);
```

#### Partitioning Strategy
```sql
-- Example table partitioning for transactions
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    merchant_id UUID NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Create monthly partitions
CREATE TABLE transactions_202308 PARTITION OF transactions
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-08-01') TO ('2023-09-01');
CREATE TABLE transactions_202309 PARTITION OF transactions
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-09-01') TO ('2023-10-01');
```

#### Read/Write Splitting
```javascript
// Example code for read/write splitting
async function getTransactionById(id) {
  // Use read replica for GET operations
  const pool = databaseService.getReadPool();
  return pool.query('SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE id = $1', [id]);
}

async function createTransaction(transactionData) {
  // Use primary database for write operations
  const pool = databaseService.getPrimaryPool();
  return pool.query('INSERT INTO transactions (...) VALUES (...) RETURNING *', [...]);
}
```

### Caching Implementation

#### Redis Configuration
```javascript
// Redis configuration
const redis = new Redis({
  host: process.env.REDIS_HOST,
  port: process.env.REDIS_PORT,
  password: process.env.REDIS_PASSWORD,
  keyPrefix: 'lsp:',
  commandTimeout: 5000,
});

// Example caching middleware
async function cachingMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  if (req.method !== 'GET') return next();
  
  const cacheKey = `api:${req.path}:${JSON.stringify(req.query)}`;
  const cachedData = await redis.get(cacheKey);
  
  if (cachedData) {
    return res.json(JSON.parse(cachedData));
  }
  
  const originalSend = res.send;
  res.send = function(body) {
    redis.set(cacheKey, body, 'EX', 300); // 5 minute TTL
    originalSend.call(this, body);
  };
  
  next();
}
```

### Load Balancing

#### API Gateway Configuration
```yaml
# Example API Gateway configuration
apiGateway:
  routes:
    - path: /api/transactions/*
      service: transaction-service
      rate_limit: 1000/minute
    
    - path: /api/merchants/*
      service: merchant-service
      rate_limit: 500/minute
    
    - path: /api/gateways/*
      service: gateway-service
      rate_limit: 300/minute
    
    - path: /api/reports/*
      service: reporting-service
      rate_limit: 100/minute
  
  global:
    cors: true
    compression: true
    request_timeout: 30s
```

## Conclusion

This scaling plan provides a roadmap for growing the LightSpeedPay platform from its current state to handling a 10x increase in transaction volume over the next 12 months. By implementing these scaling strategies in phases, we can ensure the platform maintains its performance, reliability, and security standards while accommodating rapid growth.

The plan will be reviewed and updated quarterly to adjust for actual growth patterns and to incorporate new technologies and approaches as they become available.
