# LightSpeedPay - Project Summary

## Project Overview
LightSpeedPay is a robust payment gateway wrapper service designed to simplify online payment processing for merchants. It provides a unified API interface while intelligently routing transactions through multiple payment gateways (Razorpay, PhonePe, etc.) to ensure maximum reliability and uptime.

## Key Features
1. **Smart Gateway Routing**: Intelligently selects the best payment gateway based on health, success rate, and merchant preferences
2. **Automatic Failover**: Seamlessly switches to alternative gateways if the primary gateway fails
3. **Unified API**: Single API interface for multiple payment gateways
4. **Merchant Dashboard**: Comprehensive dashboard for merchants to monitor transactions and manage settings
5. **Admin Controls**: Advanced controls for platform administrators
6. **Real-time Notifications**: Instant updates on transaction status and system events
7. **Comprehensive SDKs**: JavaScript/TypeScript and Unity SDKs for easy integration
8. **Settlement Management**: Automated settlement processing and reconciliation
9. **Alert System**: Proactive alerting for system issues and anomalies

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript, shadcn/ui, and Supabase Realtime
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Supabase
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with middleware
- **State Management**: Zustand for frontend state management
- **Form Validation**: Zod schemas for type-safe validation
- **Testing**: Jest for unit/integration tests, Cypress for E2E tests
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Current Status
The project has made significant progress with most core components implemented:

- ✅ **Backend Core**: Database schema, services, and API endpoints are complete
- ✅ **Frontend UI**: Dashboards and checkout page are implemented
- ✅ **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with role-based access control
- ✅ **Gateway Integration**: Multiple gateway adapters with selection algorithm
- ✅ **Background Jobs**: Transaction monitoring, settlements, and alerts
- ✅ **Documentation**: API docs, integration guides, and SDK examples
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Supabase Realtime integration for live data
- ✅ **Form Validation**: Zod schemas for all forms
- ✅ **Testing**: Unit tests for critical components
- ✅ **CI/CD**: Automated pipeline for testing, building, and deployment

## Current Focus
1. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Connecting the frontend UI with backend APIs
2. **Testing Implementation**: Expanding test coverage with integration and E2E tests
3. **Deployment Setup**: Configuring staging and production environments

## Upcoming Milestones
1. **Data Fetching Implementation** (ETA: 1 week)
   - Connect all frontend components to backend APIs
   - Implement proper loading and error states

2. **Comprehensive Testing** (ETA: 2 weeks)
   - Complete integration tests for payment flows
   - Implement E2E tests for critical user journeys

3. **Environment Configuration** (ETA: 1 week)
   - Set up staging environment for testing
   - Configure production environment for launch
   - Define environment-specific variables

4. **Beta Launch** (ETA: 4 weeks)
   - Onboard initial test merchants
   - Monitor system performance and gather feedback

## Technical Challenges
1. **Gateway Reliability**: Ensuring consistent behavior across different payment gateways
2. **Real-time Performance**: Optimizing real-time updates for large transaction volumes
3. **Security Hardening**: Implementing robust security measures for payment data
4. **Test Coverage**: Ensuring comprehensive test coverage for critical payment flows

## Key Decisions
1. **Gateway Selection Algorithm**: Implemented a weighted scoring system based on health, success rate, and response time
2. **Real-time Architecture**: Chose Supabase Realtime with Zustand for efficient state management
3. **Form Validation**: Selected Zod for type-safe schema validation
4. **Testing Strategy**: Adopted Jest for unit tests and Cypress for E2E tests
5. **CI/CD Strategy**: Implemented GitHub Actions with separate workflows for staging and production

## Next Steps
The immediate focus is on connecting the frontend components with backend APIs, implementing comprehensive tests, and configuring the staging and production environments. This will prepare the project for beta testing with initial merchants.
